Improovement expected from last version :
- Consolidate test resultas by cross validation -> Mitigate results with different set of testings
	-> 2 test sets with different time periods
		- Split resultats by sub-periods (monthly) to identify santard-deviation
- Simple mechanism for positionnal tracking
	- Just a new feature (rank position in time window). Be careful with the scale used.
- Check 	

Major imprrovments coming in future versions :
- Transformer set up 
	-> Encoder with other currencies pairs ? (related currencies or not ? like GPB/USD and EUR/GBP if analysis on EUR/USD ?)
	-> Decoder with currency pair to predict
		==> Idee would be to combine learned patterns from other currencies pairs and enlarge datasets. Maybe reduce time start in same time ? More than 15 years may be not so relevant ?
